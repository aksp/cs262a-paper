\section{Conclusions}
We have described and evaluated the PeerDB system. 
In particular, we have shown that PeerDB outperforms MongoDB and PostgreSQL in read mostly workloads under some conditions. 
We also displayed that this performacne increase comes at the expense of higher write times and more network traffic. 
To help developers manage these trade offs, we have presented and evaluated an automatic algorithm to suggest a low cost configuration with a given workload.
Overall, this paper contributes an evaluation which suggests benefts of embedding fields with PeerDB, and algorithms to automatically pick which fields to embed.
